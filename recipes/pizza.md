Poolish:
 - 200 g Water
 - 5 g Honey (or sugar)
 - 5 g AD Yeast
 - 200 g 00 Flour

Mix Water, Honey, Yeast, then add flour. Seal after 15 mins, let ferment for 16-24 hours in fridge. Too long and it becomes acidic.

Manitoba Flour = High Protein Flour/Bread Flour

Dough:
 - 200 g Poolish
 - 300 g Manitoba Flour
 - 200 g 00 Flour
 - 300 g Water
 - 20 g Salt

Knead for 15+ mins (adding water & salt bit by bit) until homogenous dough. Add film of olive oil to surface, let rest for 15 mins on counter.

Gently form big ball, film with oil again, cover with towel, leave on counter for 1 hour.

After 1 hour, form 4 smaller balls without breaking the formed outer crust, and let rest for another 1~2 hours. Place balls 4 fingers apart from each other and cover with cling wrap. 

Preheat pizza stone to max temperature, set oven to 500Â°F after. Pre-bake dough with tomato sauce for 3 mins, then load pizza with ingredients and finish baking for 5-7 mins, or until slightly crispy.
